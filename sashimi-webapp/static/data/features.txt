# Sashimi Note Features


Introduction
===
**Sashimi Note** is a realtime, multiplatform collaborative markdown note editor.

Note that this service is still in an early stage, and thus still has some [_issues_](https://github.com/nus-mtp/sashimi-note/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).
Please report new issues on our [GitHub](https://github.com/nus-mtp/sashimi-note/issues/new) page.
**Thank you very much!**

Workspace
===
## Modes

Edit: See only the editor. (Click on the pencil icon)
View: See only the result. (Click on the eye icon)
Both: See both in split view. (Click on the split window icon)

## Save a Note:
Currently, your files are automatically saved as an `.md` file locally.

## Import Notes:
Similarly to the _save_ feature, you can also import an `.md` file from your computer.

## Embed a Note:
Notes can be embedded as follows:

```xml
<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://google.com" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

## Slides and Pages Mode:
You can view your documents in **Slides or Pages Mode**! To do so just select **`Slides or Pages`** under the **Manage** dropdown bar!

Getting Started
===
Let's get started by learning some basic **Markdown**!

## Typography

### Headers

```
# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
```

### Horizontal Rules

___

---

***


### Typographic Replacements

Enable typographer option to see result.

(c) (C) (r) (R) (tm) (TM) (p) (P) +-

test.. test... test..... test?..... test!....

!!!!!! ???? ,,

Remarkable -- awesome

"Smartypants, double quotes"

'Smartypants, single quotes'


### Emphasis

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Deleted text~~

lu~lala~


### Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows. 


### Lists

#### Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

#### Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`
1. feafw
2. 332
3. 242
4. 2552
1. e2

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

### Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

### Tables

| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

Right aligned columns

| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|

| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

Left aligned columns

| Option | Description |

### Links

### Images
![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")
Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax
![Alt text][id]
With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:
```
Like this,
[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"
```
[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"

## Conditional Hiding
You can even choose what content to hide from View! To do so simply, include this line on the first line of the editor `fileName:*insert condition here*`, then use the following syntax:

```
For inline hiding from ALL conditions use:
=>hide Text here <=

For block hiding from *condition* use:
==>hide:*condition*
Content here
<==

Note: Only condition specified by fileName above will hide the contents
e.g. if fileName:Students, 

This hides

==>hide:Students
*Content*
<==

But, this doesn't

==>hide:Student
*Content*
<==
```
Go ahead and try it here:
<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://sashimi-note-dev.herokuapp.com/content" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Extra Features:
===
## Shortcut Keys:
Just like Sublime text, which is pretty quick and convenient.
> For more infomation, see [here](https://codemirror.net/demo/sublime.html).

## ToC:
Use the syntax `[[TOC]]` to embed table of content into your note.

[[TOC]]

## Code Block Highlighting:
We support many programming languages, click [here](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html#language-names-and-aliases) to see the entire list.
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
function $initHighlight(block, cls) {
  try {
    if (cls.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return process(block, true, 0x0F) + 
             ' class=""';
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) {
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      return /\d+[\s/]/g;
  }
}
```

## Katex & ASCIIMath

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using [**KaTeX**](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), as on [math.stackexchange.com](http://math.stackexchange.com/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
$$

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> Note: There are some mathematical expressions that KaTeX has yet to support. See [here](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php)

## UML Diagrams

### Sequence Diagrams

You can render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
Note left of Alice: Alice responds
Alice->Bob: Where have you been?
```

### Flow Charts

Flow charts can be specified like this:
```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end: End
op=>operation: My Operation
op2=>operation: lalala
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->op2->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op2
```

### Graphviz
```graphviz
digraph hierarchy {

                nodesep=1.0 // increases the separation between nodes
                
                node [color=Red,fontname=Courier,shape=box] //All nodes will this shape and colour
                edge [color=Blue, style=dashed] //All the lines look like this

                HeadStudents->{Deputy1 Deputy2 BusinessManager}
                Deputy1->{Teacher1 Teacher2}
                BusinessManager->ITManager
                {rank=same;ITManager Teacher1 Teacher2}  // Put them on the same level
}
```

### Mermaid
```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram

    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    anther task      : 24d
```
