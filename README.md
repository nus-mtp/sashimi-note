PowerPoint slides are often used to deliver lecture content to the students. The same printable PowerPoint slides are often provided to the students in a PDF format. This causes several problems. In most cases, all interactive material (*such as video, animation, things that the lecturer has said*) are removed or disabled in this format (*pdf*). Printed PowerPoint may not be the best way to represent information. It waste space and may not have an effective organisation of information.


### Our goal:
To provide a **flexible** and **extensible** document viewing and editing platform that can be used in class (during lecture) and out of class (revision) to allow lecturers to provide a more effective and comfortable learning experience to students, so that students can learn more effectively.
